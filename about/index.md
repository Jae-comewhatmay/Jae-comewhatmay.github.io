# Hi Welcome who are looking at this blog

Howdy!-

I am Jay and I am second year master student in Texas A&M University.

I’ve been seriously studying statistics since I was a junior in undergrad, so! it's been about three years now studing STATISTICS. Every semester at school, the career center is always promoting workshops on how to write a resume and communicate with recruiters. Then there's the career fair, where you see students dressed up in suits, putting on their professional masks, trying to network and make connections.

But like everyone else, it’s time for ME to find a job as a member of society. I’m excited about becoming part of a company, doing well, and working with great people. It’s real, really! I’ve dreamed of growing into a career woman since I was a teenager. Still, as I dive into the job hunt, it feels a bit limiting that all I get to show about myself is a single resume and a short conversation. That’s why I decided to start this blog.

We usually learn the basics of statistics in undergraduate. Unlike other majors, though, people often say that a master’s degree is a must for statistics students. Now that I’m in the master’s program, I’m learning more advanced and diverse methods in short time. But the time I felt the most discouraged was when a close friend of mine, who’s doing a PhD in urban planning, told me that her lab didn’t want to hire someone with a statistics background. The reason? Statistics is just a tool, and people in her field find it tedious to teach us their specialized knowledge. Of course, that’s just her personal opinion, and I’ve come to realize through meeting others that not everyone feels that way. Still, sometimes I regret choosing statistics because I don’t have deep-deep knowledge in any specific field outside of it. That’s why my biggest goal during this master’s program is to find my specialization within the world of statistics.

In conclusion, I’ve narrowed down my focus to **Biostatistics**, **Bioinformatics**, and **Machine Learning**. I’m now conducting research with a professor in Bioinformatics. It’s definitely not easy—I knew nothing about RNA transcription. But as they say, there’s no shame in not knowing but try to know it. I pushed myself to study biology independently and worked hard to master the machine learning techniques used in the field. I’m excited to share the results of this work on my blog as well.


I also want to take this opportunity to organize everything I’ve learned so far. I plan to revisit regression, time series, and Bayesian methods—not only to refresh my own understanding but to showcase my knowledge.One of my strengths is my determination to see things through once I start. I also think I’m good at adapting to new fields without getting overwhelmed. I am not only stuck in bio-stat, I am open to all of the field! Maybe that’s why I’m a good fit for statistician after all.

So that’s **my intro**!
